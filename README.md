This application helps people in measuring everyday objects around them by using their phones. To measure the object we use reference objects
in the photo along with the object to be measured. An option of 1,2,5 and 10 rupee coins are available. The user can also select a user 
defined object whose actual length they already know. The user can then either select a photo from gallery or click on. Once clicked the
user has to outline the reference object using red lines and the object to be measured in blue lines. The lines are provided in app. Database
is also available for the user to store object lengths which can later be viewed by the user.
